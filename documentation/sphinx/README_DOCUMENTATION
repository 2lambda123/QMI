Answered Questions
==================

  * Is it possible to render stuff that is in the same RST file, on different pages?

    No. See:

    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44777009/can-i-split-a-single-restructuredtext-file-into-multiple-html-pages-by-section

  * Can we add a hook to autodoc (eg for @rpc_method decorators)?

    Yes, using events, inside a self-written Sphinx extension (or inside "conf.py").

  * How do we document class member variables?

    --> Use the "Attributes" section in Google Docs style.

Unanswered questions
====================

  * Is it possible to suppress stuff (make it invisible for autodoc)?

    Check the
         :exclude-members: option!

  * How do we extend the toc-tree inside the code tree?

  * Is 'autosummary' worth it?

  * How do I widen the page?

    This is theme-specific.


Issues
======

(1) WARNING: more than one target found for cross-reference

    We accept them, for now.

(2) We use autodoc but not autosummary, for now.

(3) We get a warning from the sphinx_rtd_theme while building the documentation.
